Gork AI Story Generator is a Python-powered application that generates beautifully written, multi-chapter storybooks using the Grok model from X.ai (Gork AI). Given a simple story prompt (like “An underwater city adventure with sea dragons”), the generator produces a structured story including:

A custom story title

A creative summary

Multiple chapters (each with unique titles and detailed content)

A formatted PDF storybook output

This project leverages the Grok-2 language model API, which allows for high-quality storytelling with minimal user input. With just a few lines of code, you can turn your ideas into fully written, formatted PDFs — perfect for creative writing, children’s stories, inspiration for novels, or just for fun!
